Hey, I'm Sania 👋

I'm an Operations consultant helping teams automate workflows and work smarter with AI.


🔧 What I work on

Workflow automation — designing and building systems that eliminate repetitive ops work
Analytics & dashboards — turning messy data into insights and signals for decision-makers
AI-powered tools — practical GenAI applications using AWS, LLMs, and no-code platforms like Lovable


My all-time favourite RPG is Divinity: Original Sin II.
